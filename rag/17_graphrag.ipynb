    "# GraphRAG: Graph-Enhanced RAG\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "GraphRAG is an advanced question-answering system that combines the power of graph-based knowledge representation with retrieval-augmented generation. It processes input documents to create a rich knowledge graph, which is then used to enhance the retrieval and generation of answers to user quries. The system leverages natural language processing, machine learning, and graph theory to provide more accurate and comtextually relevant responses.\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Traditional RAG systems often struggle with maintaining context over long documents and makeing connections between related pieces of information. GraphRAG addresses these limitations by:\n",
    "1. Representing knowledge as an interconnected graph, allowing for better preservation of relationships between concepts\n",
    "2. Enabliing more intelligent traversal of information during the query process\n",
    "3. Providing a visual representation of how information is connected and accessed during the answering process\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. DocumentProcessor: Handles the initial processing of input documents, creating text chunks and embeddings\n",
    "2. KnowledgeGraph: Constructs a graph representatino of the processed documents, where nodes represent text chunks and edges represent relationships between them\n",
    "3. QueryEngine: Manages the process of answering user queries by leveraging the knowledge graph and vector store\n",
    "4. Visualizer: Creates a visual representation of the graph and the traversal path taken to answer a query\n",
    "## Beneftis of this Approach\n",
    "1. Improved Context Awareness: By representing knowledge as a graph, the system can maintain better context and make connections across different parts of the input documents\n",
    "2. Enhanced Retrieval: The graph structure allows for more intelligent retrieval of information, going beyond simple keyword matching\n",
    "3. Explainable Results: The visualization of the graph and traversal path provides insight into how the system arrived at its answer, improving transparency and trust\n",
    "4. Flexible Knowledge Representation: The graph structure can easily incorporate new information and relationships as they become available\n",
    "5. Efficient Information Traversal: The weighted edges in the graph allow the system to prioritize the most relevant information pathways when answering queries\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "GraphRAG represents a significant advancement in RAG systems. By incorporating a graph-based knowledge representation and intelligent traveral mechanisms, it offers improved context awareness, more accurate retrieval, and enhanced explainability. The system's ability to visualize its decision-making process provides valuable insights into its operation, making it a powerful tool for both end-users and developers."

    "\n",
    "        3. Concept Handling:\n",
