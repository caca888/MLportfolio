    "# Fusion Retrieval in Document Search (Hybrid Search)\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a Fusion Retrieval system that combines vector-based similarity search with keyword-based BM25 retrieval. The approach aims to leverage the strengths of both methods to improve the overall quality and relevance of document retrieval.\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Traditional retrieval methods often reply on either semantic understanding (vector-based) or keyword matching (BM25). Each appraoch has its strengths and weaknesses. Fusion retrieval aims to combine these methods to create a more robust and accurate retrieval system that can handle a wider range of queries effiectively.\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "- PDF processing and text chunking\n",
    "- Vector store creation using FAISS and embeddings\n",
    "- BM25 index creation for keyword-based retrieval\n",
    "- Custom fusion retrieval function that combines both methods\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "- Improved Retrieval Quality: By combing semantic and keyword-based search, the system can capture both conceptual similarity and exact keyword matches\n",
    "- Flexibility: The `alpha` parameter allows for adjusting the balance between vector and keyword search based on sepcific use cases or query types\n",
    "- Robustness: The combined appraoch can handle a wider range of queries effectively, mitgating weaknesses of individual methods\n",
    "- Customizability: The sytem can be easily adapted to use different vector stores or keyword-based retrieval methods\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Fusion retrieval represents a powerful approach to document search that combines the strengths of semantic understanding and keyword matching. By leveraging both vector-based and BM25 retrieval methods, it offers a more comprehensive and flexible solutin for information retrieval tasks."
