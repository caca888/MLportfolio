    "# Document Augmentation Through Question Generation for Enhanced Retrieval\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This implementation demonstrates a text augmentation technique that leverages additional question generation to improve document retrieval within a vectore database. By generating and incorporating various questions related to each text fragment, the system enhances the standard retrieval process, thus increasing the likelihood of finding relevant documents that can be utilized as context for generative question answering.\n",
    "## Movtivation\n",
    "By enriching text fragments with related questions, we aim to significantly enhance the accuracy of identifying the most relevant sections of a document that contain answers to user queries.\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "1. PDF Processing and Text Chunking: Handling PDF documents and dividing them into manageable text fragments\n",
    "2. Question Augmentation: Generating relevan questions at both the document and fragment levels using LLM\n",
    "3. Vector Store Ceation: Calculating embeddings for documents using LLM and creating a FAISS vector store\n",
    "4. REtrieval and Answer Generation: Finding the most relevant document using FAISS and generating answers based ont he context provided\n",
    "## Mothod Detail\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "- Convert PDF to a string using PyPDFLoader from LangChain\n",
    "- Split the text into overlapping text documents (text_document) for building context purpose and then each document to overlapping text fragments (text_fragment) for retrieval and semantic search purpose.\n",
    "### Document Augmentation\n",
    "- Generate questions at the document or text fragment level using LLM\n",
    "- Configure the number of questions to generate using the QUESTIONS_PER_DOCUMENT constant\n",
    "### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "- Use the Embddings to compute document vector\n",
    "- Create a FAISS vectore store from these embeddings\n",
    "### Retrieval and Generation\n",
    "- Retrieve the most relevant document from the FAISS store based on the given query\n",
    "- Use the retrieved document as context for generating answers with LLM\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "- Enhanced Retrieval Process: Increases the probability of finding the most relevant FAISS document for a given query\n",
    "- Felxible Context Adjustment: Allows for easy adjustment of the context window size for both text documents and fragments\n",
    "- High-Quality Language Understanding: Leverages LLM for question generation and answer production\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This technique provides a method to improve the quality of information retrieval in vector-based document search systems. By generating additional questions similar to user queries and utilizing LLM, it potentially leads to better comprehension and more accurate responses in subsequent tasks, such as question answering."
